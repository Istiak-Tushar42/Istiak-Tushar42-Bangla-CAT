                                        Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing “BanglaCAT
                                        Alumni Forum” will cause the Bangla Trac’s system software to create a number of
                                        cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s
                                        web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user
                                        identifier (hereinafter “user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier
                                        (hereinafter “session-id”), automatically assigned to you by system software. A
                                        third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within “BanglaCAT
                                        Alumni Forum” and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby
                                        improving your user experience.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="single-item">

                                        We may also create cookies external to the system software whilst browsing
                                        “BanglaCAT Alumni Forum”, though these are outside the scope of this document
                                        which is intended to only cover the pages created by the applied system
                                        software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you
                                        submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as a member user
                                        (hereinafter “member’s posts”), by registering on “BanglaCAT Alumni Forum”
                                        (hereinafter “your account”) and posts submitted by you after registration and

                                        account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid email address
                                        (hereinafter “your email”). Your information for your account at “BanglaCAT

                                        websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at “BanglaCAT

                                        another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget
                                        your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature
                                        provided by the system software. This process will ask you to submit your user
                                        name and your email, then the functional software will generate a new password
                                        to reclaim your account.</p>
